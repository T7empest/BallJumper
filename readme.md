# 🎮 BallJumper

BallJumper is a 2D arcade-style platformer written in modern C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). The goal is to climb upward by jumping across falling balls without getting hit or falling off.

This project was built as a showcase of low-level game programming fundamentals — including collision handling, simple physics, ECS principles, and build system management with CMake.
